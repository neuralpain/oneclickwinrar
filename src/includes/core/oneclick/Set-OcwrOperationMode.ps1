function Set-OcwrOperationMode {
  <#
    .SYNOPSIS
      Determine the primary operation mode.

    .DESCRIPTION
      This function determines the primary operation mode based on
      $script:custom_name, which would have been standardized by
      `Confirm-SpecialSwitch` if it was a variant.

      If $script:custom_name still contains a special code (e.g. "onecl0ckrar"),
      it will fall to the 'default' case here if not matched by specific
      variants. The special code itself is handled by `Get-SpecialCode`.

    .NOTES
      Single reference within `Confirm-ConfigData`.
