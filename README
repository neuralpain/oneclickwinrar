oneclickwinrar - install and license WinRAR
-------------------------------------------

there was a need for something versatile // so why not?

`oneclickrar.cmd` - download, install and license WinRAR
`installrar.cmd` - download and install WinRAR
`licenserar.cmd` - license WinRAR if installed

- can only download WinRAR v6.23 (64-bit)
- will install and license any version available in the current directory
- all operations are done at `C:\Program Files\WinRAR` for 64-bit operating systems unless a 32-bit WinRAR installer is provided
- check the releases page for downloads (or download from the repository; whichever you prefer)
